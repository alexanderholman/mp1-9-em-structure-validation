# MP1.9 - Electron Microscopy Structure Validation

## Goal

Demonstrate that a dual-axis model reproduces interface structure observed by electron microscopy.

## Deliverables

- Side-by-side experiment vs simulation structural comparisons
- Orientation/facet-index mapping for the compared structures
- Quantitative agreement metrics (angles, segment lengths, junction descriptors)

## Checklist

- [ ] Define microscopy-derived geometric targets
- [ ] Align simulation and microscopy coordinate conventions
- [ ] Compute and report agreement metrics with thresholds
- [ ] Draft validation section for macro paper
